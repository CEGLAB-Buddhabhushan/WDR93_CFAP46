Analysis Description
--------------------
RELAX (a random effects test of selection relaxation) uses a random
effects branch-site model framework to test whether a set of 'Test'
branches evolves under relaxed selection relative to a set of
'Reference' branches (R), as measured by the relaxation parameter (K).
Version 2.1 adds a check for stability in K estimates to try to mitigate
convergence problems. Version 3 provides support for >2 branch sets.
Version 3.1 adds LHC + Nedler-Mead initial fit phase and keyword
support. Version 3.1.1 adds some bug fixes for better convergence.
Version 4.0 adds support for synonymous rate variation. Version 4.1 adds
further support for multiple hit models

- __Requirements__: in-frame codon alignment and a phylogenetic tree, with at least two
groups of branches defined using the {} notation (one group can be
defined as all unlabeled branches)
